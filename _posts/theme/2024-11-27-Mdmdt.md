1. Open `Preferences` -> `Appearance` -> `Open Theme Folder`
2. Copy `mdmdt-light.css` or `mdmdt-dark.css ` to the theme folder.
3. **Exit Typora and reopen**，In the `Menu Bar` -> `Themes`, Select **Mdmdt Light** or **Mdmdt Dark** theme and complete the theme switch.


# Modify font
If you are not satisfied with the font, you can modify the corresponding font as follows:

1. Modify the font of the main text, find `body {font-family:"PingFang SC",..., !important;}` 、`body.os-windows {font-family: Helvetica,..., !important;}` and `textarea {...}`, and add the font you want to use at the beginning of `font-family:`, such as `font-family: "name of the font you want to use", Helvetica, ..., !important;`

2. Modify the font of the code, find `code, tt {...}` and `pre {...}`, and add `font-family: "name of the font you want to use" !important;`  Then modify `.os-windows pre,.os-windows code {font-family: initial !important;}` , such as `font-family: "name of the font you want to use" !important;`

**Attention: The prerequisite for changing the font is that the corresponding font is installed on your computer, otherwise the modification is invalid.**
